## Portfolio Projects
### Data-Driven Standard Operating Procedure For Processing Damages

Spearheaded the development and implementation of a standard operating procedure with the goal to reduce $300k in damages weekly. Utilizing Excel to gather data on a daily basis, I kept track of daily costs, problem-recurring SKUs, trends, damaged and return to stock daily ratios. After a 6 month period I presented the data and results to our senior team, ultimately getting it approved to go company wide starting next quarter.

### Receiving Audit Report and Process Implementation

The audit report primarily focused on the receiving side of the operation. After clarifying the expectations for the new process, we began to collect data. We promoted an environment of mutual support, addressing and correcting issues before they left the dock.

We typically had 15-20 truckloads of products scheduled daily, each tied to receiving authorizations (RA) and an expected list of contents. However, the actual contents often varied. The receiving process posed numerous technical challenges. All pallets had to adhere to several guidelines: no mixed pallets, the same product per pallet, and confirmed quantity. Each pallet also needed the correct SKU tag for the product. We were thorough during the data collection and auditing processes to ensure quality. This data was then entered into the Receiving Audit Report.

My goal was to provide personalized feedback to each receiver based on their individual weaknesses. To accomplish this, I implemented action codes to identify the types of errors being made. This approach not only helps us discern error patterns, but also allows us to track improvement trends, which we can share with the team on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis. Upon inheriting this role, the overall error rate for all RAs for the team stood at 22%. We aimed to collect our data based on each RA and SKU (unique identifier for the product). Gathering data for RAs with multiple SKUs proved to be both challenging and time-consuming. Below is an example of how this process looked.

Following a period of data collection, we were able to visually represent improvements by comparing set times. The process was well-received and generated positive feedback. Here, we compare data from August to September. Our goal was to audit 90% of all given RAs, which yielded a robust dataset for comparison. By the end of September, the error rate had significantly declined from the initial 22% to consistently below 1%.
